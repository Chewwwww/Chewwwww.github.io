Hello! My name is Chi-Hao Wu. I am currently a PhD student working under the guidance of Dr. Jacob Bedrossian. Before, I was a master student of Dr. Ting-Li Chen in Taiwan. 

I am interested in random dynamical systems (RDS), PDE and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC). Currently, I am interested in studying mathematical properties in plasma models.
